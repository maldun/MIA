Attempt to create my own virtual assistant. This project can be seen as long term and evolving.
It is not the goal to make state of the art algorithms, but to deepen my understanding of machine learning, by trying out
to automate everyday tasks, and machine communication.

Notes
==================
It may be necessary to reset before if docker makes problem ... e.g. with podman do `podman system reset`

Programm Structure
==================

I now aim to use ollama as a basis.
So a big rewrite is coming ...

Tasks
=====

- Scheduling: One of the main tasks is to provide an efficient work schedule for every day life.
- Communication: Communication with the user
